>> Use the Comparison Theorem to determine whether the integral is convergent or divergent. So we're looking at the integral from 0 to infinity of x over x cubed + 1. Well, let's take a look at this integrand. For x > 0, that's what we're talking about. We're not going to do x > or equal to 0. You'll see why in a second, but for x strictly > 0, x over x cubed + 1, this plus 1 in the denominator here is making that denominator a little bit bigger. It's making that denominator a little bit bigger so that is < x over x cubed. And I'm going to reduce it to this case so I'm going to take x strictly > 0. And this is equal to 1 over x squared for x strictly > 0. The integral from 1 to infinity of 1 over x squared dx converges. So by the Comparison Theorem, the integral from 1 to infinity of x over x cubed + 1 converges. Now, if you notice, that's not the integral in question. That is not the integral in question. The integral in question is the integral from zero to infinity. So the integral from zero to infinity of x over x cubed + 1 -- now 0 is not a problem here because of this plus 1 in the denominator. That integral we're going to note is the integral from 0 to 1 of x over x cubed + 1 plus the integral from 1 to infinity of x over x cubed + 1. So this is equal to this, and the integral from 0 to 1 of this function is finite. So I should have since -- since the integral from 0 to infinity is the integral from 0 to 1 plus the integral from 1 to infinity and the integral from 0 to 1 is just a standard integral, so that's finite. And this is finite. We have that the integral from 0 to infinity of x over x cubed + 1 dx is convergent is finite thing. So how do we figure this out? We took finite + finite = finite.
